I once took a one credit karate class, and our final exam involved doing a word search puzzle so I wrote a python program to solve it.

sheet1.txt: original crossword puzzle which I hand typed into the text file.
find.txt: list of words to  be searched for
found.txt: words from find.txt as they are in sheet1.txt

Enjoy!
